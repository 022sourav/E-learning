        What is Python? <br>
        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

        It is used for: <br>

        web development (server-side), <br>
        software development, <br>
        mathematics, <br>
        system scripting. <br><br>
        What can Python do? <br>
        Python can be used on a server to create web applications. <br>
        Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. <br>
        Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. <br>
        Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. <br>
        Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. <br><br>
        Why Python? <br>
        Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). <br>
        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. <br>
        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
        languages. <br>
        Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. <br>This means
        that prototyping can be very quick. <br>
        Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
        Good to know <br>
        The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python
        2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. <br>
        In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. <br>It is possible to write Python in an Integrated
        Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when
        managing larger collections of Python files. <br>
        Python Syntax compared to other programming languages <br>
        Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from
        mathematics. <br>
        Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use
        semicolons or parentheses. <br>
        Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and
        classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. <br>
        Example <br>
        print("Hello, World!") <br><br>

        Python Syntax <br>
        Execute Python Syntax <br>
        As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line: <br>

        >>> print("Hello, World!") <br>
        Hello, World! <br>

        Python Indentation <br>
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. <br>

        Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python
        <br>
        is very important. <br>

        Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. <br><br>

        Example <br>
        if 5 > 2: <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>
        Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation: <br><br>

        Example <br>
        Syntax Error: <br>

        if 5 > 2: <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>
        The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
        <br><br>

        Example <br>
        if 5 > 2: <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>
        if 5 > 2: <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>
        You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
        <br><br>

        Example <br>
        Syntax Error: <br>

        if 5 > 2: <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>
        print("Five is greater than two!") <br>

        Python Variables <br>
        In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it: <br><br>

        Example <br>
        Variables in Python: <br>

        x = 5 <br>
        y = "Hello, World!" <br>
        Python has no command for declaring a variable. <br>

        You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter. <br>

        Comments <br>
        Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation. <br>

        Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment: <br><br>

        Example <br>
        Comments in Python: <br>

        #This is a comment. <br>
        print("Hello, World!") <br>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

        Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. <br>

        'hello' is the same as "hello". <br>

        You can display a string literal with the print() function: <br>

        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        print("Hello") <br>
        print('Hello') <br>
        Assign String to a Variable <br>
        Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string: <br>

        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        a = "Hello" <br>
        print(a) <br>
        Multiline Strings <br>
        You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes: <br>

        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        You can use three double quotes: <br>

        a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <br>
        consectetur adipiscing elit, <br>
        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt <br>
        ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.""" <br>
        print(a) <br>
        Or three single quotes: <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <br>
        consectetur adipiscing elit, <br>
        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt <br>
        ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.''' <br>
        print(a) <br>
        Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code. <br>
        <br>
        Strings are Arrays
        Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode
        characters. <br>
        <br>
        However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
        <br>

        Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string. <br>

        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0): <br>

        a = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(a[1]) <br>
        Looping Through a String <br>
        Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        Loop through the letters in the word "banana": <br>
        <br>
        for x in "banana": <br>
        print(x) <br>
        Learn more about For Loops in our Python For Loops chapter. <br>
        <br>
        String Length <br>
        To get the length of a string, use the len() function. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        The len() function returns the length of a string: <br>
        <br>
        a = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(len(a)) <br>
        Check String <br>
        To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        Check if "free" is present in the following text: <br>
        <br>
        txt = "The best things in life are free!" <br>
        print("free" in txt) <br>
        Use it in an if statement: <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        Print only if "free" is present: <br>
        <br>
        txt = "The best things in life are free!" <br>
        if "free" in txt: <br>
        print("Yes, 'free' is present.") <br>
        Learn more about If statements in our Python If...Else chapter. <br>
        <br>
        Check if NOT <br>
        To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Example</strong> <br>
        Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text: <br>

        txt = "The best things in life are free!" <br>
        print("expensive" not in txt) <br>
        Use it in an if statement: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        print only if "expensive" is NOT present: <br>
        <br>
        txt = "The best things in life are free!" <br>
        if "expensive" not in txt: <br>
        print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.") <br>
        <br>

        Python - Slicing Strings <br>
        Slicing <br>
        You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax. <br>

        Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included): <br>
        <br>
        b = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(b[2:5]) <br>
        Note: The first character has index 0. <br>
        <br>
        Slice From the Start <br>
        By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included): <br>
        <br>
        b = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(b[:5]) <br>
        <br>
        Slice To the End <br>
        By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end: <br>

        b = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(b[2:]) <br>
        Negative Indexing <br>
        Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string: <br>
        Example <br>
        Get the characters: <br>

        From: "o" in "World!" (position -5) <br>

        To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2): <br>

        b = "Hello, World!" <br>
        print(b[-5:-2]) <br>
        <br>
        Python - String Methods <br>
        String Methods <br>
        Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings. <br>
        <br>

        <h3>List</h3> <br>
        Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. <br>

        Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set,
        and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. <br>

        Lists are created using square brackets: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Create a List: <br>

        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        print(thislist) <br>
        List Items <br>
        List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. <br>

        List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc. <br>

        Ordered <br>
        When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not
        change. <br>

        If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list. <br>

        Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not
        change. <br>

        Changeable <br>
        The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
        <br>

        Allow Duplicates <br>
        Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Lists allow duplicate values: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"] <br>
        print(thislist) <br>
        ADVERTISEMENT
        <br>
        List Length <br>
        To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the number of items in the list: <br>

        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        print(len(thislist)) <br>
        List Items - Data Types <br>
        List items can be of any data type: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        String, int and boolean data types: <br>

        list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3] <br>
        list3 = [True, False, False] <br>
        A list can contain different data types: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        A list with strings, integers and boolean values: <br>
        <br>
        list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"] <br>
        type() <br>
        From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list': <br>
        <br>
        &lt;class 'list'&gt; <br>
        Example <br>
        What is the data type of a list? <br>
        <br>
        mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        print(type(mylist)) <br>
        The list() Constructor <br>
        It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Using the list() constructor to make a List: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets <br>
        print(thislist) <br>

        <h2>Python - Access List Items</h2> <br>
        Access Items <br>
        List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the second item of the list: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        print(thislist[1]) <br>
        Note: The first item has index 0. <br>
        <br>
        Negative Indexing <br>
        Negative indexing means start from the end <br>
        <br>
        -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the last item of the list: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
        print(thislist[-1]) <br>
        Range of Indexes <br>
        You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range. <br>
        <br>
        When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Return the third, fourth, and fifth item: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"] <br>
        print(thislist[2:5]) <br>
        Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included). <br>
        <br>
        Remember that the first item has index 0. <br>
        <br>
        By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "kiwi": <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"] <br>
        print(thislist[:4]) <br>
        By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        This example returns the items from "cherry" to the end: <br>
        <br>
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"] <br>
        print(thislist[2:]) <br>

        Tuple <br>
        Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. <br>
        <br>
        Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set,
        and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. <br>
        <br>
        A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. <br>
        <br>
        Tuples are written with round brackets. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Create a Tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        print(thistuple) <br>
        Tuple Items <br>
        Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values. <br>
        <br>
        Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc. <br>
        <br>
        Ordered <br>
        When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not
        change. <br>
        <br>
        Unchangeable <br>
        Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
        <br>
        <br>
        Allow Duplicates <br>
        Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Tuples allow duplicate values: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry") <br>
        print(thistuple) <br>
        <br>
        Tuple Length <br>
        To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the number of items in the tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        print(len(thistuple)) <br>
        Create Tuple With One Item <br>
        To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not
        recognize it as a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        One item tuple, remember the comma: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple",) <br>
        print(type(thistuple)) <br>
        <br>
        #NOT a tuple <br>
        thistuple = ("apple") <br>
        print(type(thistuple)) <br>
        Tuple Items - Data Types <br>
        Tuple items can be of any data type: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        String, int and boolean data types: <br>
        <br>
        tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3) <br>
        tuple3 = (True, False, False) <br>
        A tuple can contain different data types: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        A tuple with strings, integers and boolean values: <br>
        <br>
        tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male") <br>
        type() <br>
        From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple': <br>
        <br>
        &lt;class 'tuple'&gt; <br>
        Example <br>
        What is the data type of a tuple? <br>
        <br>
        mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        print(type(mytuple)) <br>
        The tuple() Constructor <br>
        It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Using the tuple() method to make a tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets <br>
        print(thistuple) <br><br>

        <h3>Python - Update Tuples</h3> <br>
        Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created. <br>
        <br>
        But there are some workarounds. <br>
        <br>
        Change Tuple Values <br>
        Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is
        called. <br>
        <br>
        But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back
        into a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it: <br>
        <br>
        x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        y = list(x) <br>
        y[1] = "kiwi" <br>
        x = tuple(y) <br>
        <br>
        print(x) <br>
        Add Items <br>
        Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a build-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items
        to a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your
        item(s), and convert it back into a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Convert the tuple into a list, add "orange", and convert it back into a tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        y = list(thistuple) <br>
        y.append("orange") <br>
        thistuple = tuple(y) <br>
        2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many),
        create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        y = ("orange",) <br>
        thistuple += y <br>
        <br>
        print(thistuple) <br>
        Note: When creating a tuple with only one item, remember to include a comma after the item, otherwise it will
        not be identified as a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Remove Items <br>
        Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple. <br>
        <br>
        Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for
        changing and adding tuple items: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Convert the tuple into a list, remove "apple", and convert it back into a tuple: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        y = list(thistuple) <br>
        y.remove("apple") <br>
        thistuple = tuple(y) <br>
        Or you can delete the tuple completely: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        The del keyword can delete the tuple completely: <br>
        <br>
        thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
        del thistuple <br>
        print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists <br>

        <h3>Python - Tuple Methods</h3><br>
        Tuple Methods <br>
        Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples. <br>
        <br>
        Method Description <br>
        count() Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple <br>
        index() Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found <br>

        <h3>Sets</h3><br><br>
        myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        Set <br>
        Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. <br>
        <br>
        Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple,
        and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>

        A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. <br>
        <br>
        * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. <br>
        <br>
        Sets are written with curly brackets. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Create a Set: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear. <br>
        <br>
        Set Items <br>
        Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values. <br>
        <br>
        Unordered <br>
        Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order. <br>
        <br>
        Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unchangeable <br>
        Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created. <br>
        <br>
        Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items. <br>
        <br>
        Duplicates Not Allowed <br>
        Sets cannot have two items with the same value. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Duplicate values will be ignored: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"} <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br><br>

        <h3>Python - Add Set Items</h3> <br>
        Add Items <br>
        Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items. <br>
        <br>
        To add one item to a set use the add() method. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Add an item to a set, using the add() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        <br>
        thisset.add("orange") <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Add Sets <br>
        To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Add elements from tropical into thisset: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"} <br>
        <br>
        thisset.update(tropical) <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Add Any Iterable <br>
        The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists,
        dictionaries etc.). <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Add elements of a list to at set: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"] <br>
        <br>
        thisset.update(mylist) <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>

        <h3> Python - Remove Set Items</h3> <br>
        Remove Item <br>
        To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Remove "banana" by using the remove() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        <br>
        thisset.remove("banana") <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Remove "banana" by using the discard() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        <br>
        thisset.discard("banana") <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error. <br>
        <br>
        You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove the last item. Remember that
        sets are unordered, so you will not know what item that gets removed. <br>
        <br>
        The return value of the pop() method is the removed item. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Remove the last item by using the pop() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} <br>
        <br>
        x = thisset.pop() <br>
        <br>
        print(x) <br>
        <br>
        print(thisset) <br>
        Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed. <br><br>

        <h3>Python - Set Methods</h3> <br>
        Set Methods <br>
        Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on sets. <br>
        <br>
        Method Description <br>
        add() --> Adds an element to the set <br>
        clear() --> Removes all the elements from the set <br>
        copy() --> Returns a copy of the set <br>
        difference() --> Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets <br>
        difference_update() --> Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set <br>
        discard() --> Remove the specified item <br>
        intersection() --> Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets <br>
        intersection_update() --> Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s) <br>
        isdisjoint() --> Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not <br>
        issubset() --> Returns whether another set contains this set or not <br>
        issuperset() --> Returns whether this set contains another set or not <br>
        pop() --> Removes an element from the set <br>
        remove() --> Removes the specified element <br>
        symmetric_difference() --> Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets <br>
        symmetric_difference_update() --> inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another <br>
        union() --> Return a set containing the union of sets <br>
        update() --> Update the set with the union of this set and others <br>

        Dictionary <br>
        Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. <br>
        <br>
        A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. <br>
        <br>
        As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered. <br>
        <br>
        Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values: <br>
        <br>

        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        Dictionary Items <br>
        Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates. <br>
        <br>
        Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the "brand" value of the dictionary: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        print(thisdict["brand"]) <br>
        Ordered or Unordered? <br>
        As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered. <br>
        <br>
        When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not
        change. <br>
        <br>
        Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
        <br>
        <br>
        Changeable <br>
        Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been
        created. <br>
        <br>
        Duplicates Not Allowed <br>
        Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Duplicate values will overwrite existing values: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964, <br>
        "year": 2020 <br>
        } <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        <br>
        Dictionary Length <br>
        To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the number of items in the dictionary: <br>
        <br>
        print(len(thisdict)) <br>
        Dictionary Items - Data Types <br>
        The values in dictionary items can be of any data type: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        String, int, boolean, and list data types: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "electric": False, <br>
        "year": 1964, <br>
        "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"] <br>
        } <br>
        type() <br>
        From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict': <br>
        <br>
        &lt;class 'dict'&gt; <br>
        Example <br>
        Print the data type of a dictionary: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        print(type(thisdict)) <br>

        <h3>Python - Change Dictionary Items</h3> <br>
        Change Values <br>
        You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Change the "year" to 2018: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict["year"] = 2018 <br>
        Update Dictionary <br>
        The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument. <br>
        <br>
        The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Update the "year" of the car by using the update() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict.update({"year": 2020}) <br>

        <h3>Python - Add Dictionary Items</h3> <br>
        Adding Items <br>
        Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict["color"] = "red" <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        Update Dictionary <br>
        The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. If the item does not exist,
        the item will be added. <br>
        <br>
        The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs. <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        Add a color item to the dictionary by using the update() method: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict.update({"color": "red"}) <br>

        <h3>Python - Remove Dictionary Items</h3> <br>
        Removing Items <br>
        There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary: <br>
        <br>
        Example <br>
        The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict.pop("model") <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        Example <br>
        The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
        <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict.popitem() <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        Example <br>
        The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        del thisdict["model"] <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>
        Example <br>
        The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        del thisdict <br>
        print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists. <br>
        Example <br>
        The clear() method empties the dictionary: <br>
        <br>
        thisdict = { <br>
        "brand": "Ford", <br>
        "model": "Mustang", <br>
        "year": 1964 <br>
        } <br>
        thisdict.clear() <br>
        print(thisdict) <br>

        <h3>Python Dictionary Methods</h3> <br>
        Dictionary Methods <br>
        Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries. <br>
        <br>
        Method Description <br>
        clear() --> Removes all the elements from the dictionary <br>
        copy() --> Returns a copy of the dictionary <br>
        fromkeys() --> Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value <br>
        get() --> Returns the value of the specified key <br>
        items() --> Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair <br>
        keys() --> Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys <br>
        pop() --> Removes the element with the specified key <br>
        popitem() --> Removes the last inserted key-value pair <br>
        setdefault() --> Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the
        specified value <br>
        update() --> Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs <br>
        values() --> Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary <br>
